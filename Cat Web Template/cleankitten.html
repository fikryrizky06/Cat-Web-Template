            <h1>Clean Kittens</h1>
            <p>Keeping kittens clean is crucial for their health. If the mother is unavailable, use a damp, warm cloth to gently wipe the kitten's fur, focusing on the face, paws, and genital area to prevent infections.</p>
            <p>Regularly change their bedding to maintain hygiene. Dirty bedding can harbor harmful bacteria and parasites. Use soft, washable materials and wash them frequently to keep the sleeping area clean and comfortable.            </p>
            <p>Start litter training around four weeks old. Use a shallow box with unscented, non-clumping litter. Place the kitten in the box after meals and gently scratch their paws in the litter. Keep the litter box clean by scooping it daily and changing the litter regularly.</p>
