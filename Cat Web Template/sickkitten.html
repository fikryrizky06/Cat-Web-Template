            <h1>Sick Kittens</h1>
            <p>Protecting kittens from diseases starts with vaccinations. Ensure they receive their initial vaccinations at six to eight weeks old, followed by boosters as recommended by your veterinarian. Vaccinations protect against common illnesses like feline distemper and upper respiratory infections.</p>
            <p>Maintain good hygiene to prevent disease. Regularly clean their living area, food, and water dishes. Wash your hands before and after handling them to reduce the risk of spreading germs. Keeping their environment clean is crucial for their health.</p>
            <p>Schedule regular vet check-ups to monitor their health and catch any issues early. Routine examinations help detect potential problems before they become serious. Follow your vet's advice on deworming and flea prevention to keep parasites at bay.</p>
