            <h1>Feeding Kittens</h1>
            <p>Feeding kittens properly is essential for their growth. For the first four weeks, kittens need their mother's milk or a kitten milk replacer. When bottle-feeding, use kitten-specific formula and avoid cow's milk. Feed every 2-3 hours, including nighttime. Gradually introduce wet kitten food around four weeks, mixing it with formula to ease the transition to solids.</p>
            <p>Hydration is crucial. Always provide fresh, clean water once kittens start on solid food. Encourage drinking by offering shallow dishes and monitoring intake, especially if they eat dry kibble. Wet food helps with hydration due to its moisture content. Ensure a balanced diet with the necessary nutrients for growth, including proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals.</p>
            <p>Establish good eating habits early by creating a feeding routine. Serve meals at the same times daily for structure. Use shallow dishes for comfort and consider separate feeding areas for multiple kittens to prevent competition. Keep the feeding area clean to avoid infections.</p>
