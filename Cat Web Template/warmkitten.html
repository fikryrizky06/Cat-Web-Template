            <h1>Warm Kittens</h1>
            <p>Keeping kittens warm is vital for their health, especially in the first few weeks when they cannot regulate their body temperature. Use heating pads specifically designed for pets, set to a safe, low temperature, and place them under a blanket or towel to prevent burns. Alternatively, hot water bottles wrapped in soft cloth can be used but need regular refilling.</p>
            <p>Create a cozy and insulated space using a sturdy box or pet carrier lined with soft, clean bedding like blankets or towels. Keep the bedding dry and change it frequently. Position the box in a draft-free area away from windows and doors. The ideal temperature for newborn kittens is between 85-90°F (29-32°C) for the first week, gradually decreasing to around 75°F (24°C) by the fourth week.</p>
            <p>Monitor the kittens' body temperature regularly. Signs of being too cold include lethargy, lack of appetite, and crying. If a kitten is too cold, warm them gently with your body heat or warm towels, avoiding rapid temperature changes. Consult a veterinarian if you have concerns about a kitten’s temperature or health.</p>
